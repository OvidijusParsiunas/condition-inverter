## Features
Condition Inverter has been designed to invert conditional syntax within if statements, ternary operarators, conditional assignments and many more! It is also fully functional in html templates!


## Theory
This tool takes an input condition, analyzes it and produces a new condition that yields an absolute opposite result. This is illustrated by the following table:

| Properties | Original condition | Result | Inverted condition | Result |
| :---  | :---  | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| dog = true, cat = false | dog && cat | false  | !dog &#124; &#124; !cat | true |
| dog = 3, cat = 2 | dog < cat  | false |  dog >= cat | true |

## Language Support
Condition Inverter supports all *modern* progrogramming languages and frameworks. This includes technologies that have been ranked as the most popular on the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies). <br>
As a disclaimer this tool does not currently support query, shell scripting or assembly based languages.
