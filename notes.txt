bug with shift assignment - make sure that < is not follwoed by another < and > not followed by another >

when current cursor at the end and inversion occurs - a cursor selection is created

"key": "ctrl+shift+i",
"mac": "cmd+shift+i",


Suggestions:

If removing the brackets along with the exclamation marks are too much:
E.g:
if (!(hello)) = if (hello)

The code can easily be changed to fit this by simply removing the code at REF - 1889


Knowledge:

REF - 2000
The project does not have bracket depth inference as it is designed to analyse the if statement during a single traversal.
This means that the following will not be simplified by removing the exclamation mark and the bracket:
E.g:
if ((!(hello)))

and will instead result:

if (!(hello))

The core reason for this is the algorithm doesn't know that !(hello) should not be marked for inversion upfront,
hence it always takes the safer path and invert the first bracket immediately:

if ((!(hello) && cat) || cat) = if (!(!(hello) && cat) && !cat)

Depth analysis to take into account at what bracket level the statement should be inverted at should be implemented:
The following:

if (((hello && cat) || cat))

should result with:

if ((!(hello && cat) && !cat))

instead of:
if (!((hello && cat) || cat))
