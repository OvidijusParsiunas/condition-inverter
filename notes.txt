TO-DO:

Overall:

tasks:
* Get a logo for the app
* Update all of the readmes
* Extension files that are not needed to run, should be ignored
* change gif sizes to use 100% for all repos
* use active/backup assets folder structure
* figure out how to lint the shared folder

not sure if individual test:coverage scripts are needed

EXTENSION:

Outstanding ISSUES with highlighed html tags:

The following highlight selection: |text <dog>| - will result in the selection to be changed to |text <dogs|> and the inversion will result in |text >=dogs|>
this is difficult to fix as <if="|condition">| needs to have the selection to be changed to <if="|condition"|>
Likewise, text |<div>div content</div>| will result in the selection to be changed to <|div>div content</div>| and the inversion will result in <|div<=div content</div>|
this originates from a similar problem to the fact that |<div if="condition|"> needs to have the selection changed to <|div if="condition|"> to be inverted correctly

The ONLY way the above can be fixed is having one side of the cursor selection to be changed by what is on the other side of the selection.

On multiline statements, if a condition indicator is not on the same line as the condition and the cursor has been selected (not highlighted) after the condition word, it will not be inverted:

if (
  condition|
)

Will result in:

if (
  condition|
)

the reason for this is because if there selected cursor is after a word, it will not traverse upwards to find the condition indicator (for performance), hence the following is sent to
the inverter:

condition\n)

which is not inverted


esbuild is used to bundle and minify the code into a single file. It exports the file to out/extension.js (just like the normal compiled version)
and not not a different directory because the 'main' property inside the package.json file is used to denote the extension export file and is
additionally used for code coverage, hence the file pointing at main needs to be the unminified for test coverage and minified for publishing
the extension


WEBSITE:

the website has an alternative top right logo that is a github corner, however decided to not use it as we need to use a vscode logo as well

currently not detecting the language used, but can implement this via:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/lang-detector

Suggestions:

If removing the brackets along with the exclamation marks is too much:
E.g:
if (!(hello)) = if (hello)

The code can easily be changed to fit this by simply removing the code at REF - 1889




KNOWLEDGE:

if test coverage is not meeting the threshold exclusively in Windows, need to make sure that the imports from shared/inverter are module paths and not relative paths
e.g. for code:
change :import { Tokens } from '../../../../../../../../shared/inverter/src/shared/types/tokens';
to: import { Tokens } from 'shared/inverter/src/shared/types/tokens';

for tests:
change: import { Inverter } from '../../../../../shared/out/inverter/src/inverter';
to: import { Inverter } from 'shared/inverter/src/inverter';




STRATEGY:

REF - 1334
When the user has highlighted or selected an arbitrary position within a line, the algorithm attempts to expand and find the closest condition indicator on the left and right,
however to not have to traverse upwards and downwards infinitely, it looks for the first non space token on each side and then attempts to find the condition indicator on that line

REF - 1335
Strategy for extending user cursor selection in VSCode exntension when working with HTML:
If cursor is between >|<, selection is extended to both sides to prevent symbol inversion by the inverter |><|
If cursor is at start of editor and the first token is < or end of editor and last token is >, do not include them in the selection - e.g. |< changed to <| and >| changed to |>
If cursor is beside < or > - the general strategy (as above) is to not include them in the selection
