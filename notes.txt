bug with shift assignment - make sure that < is not follwoed by another < and > not followed by another >

extension:
when current cursor at the end and inversion occurs - a cursor selection is created

"key": "ctrl+shift+i",
"mac": "cmd+shift+i",

website:

currently not detecting the language used, but can implement this via:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/lang-detector

Suggestions:

If removing the brackets along with the exclamation marks are too much:
E.g:
if (!(hello)) = if (hello)

The code can easily be changed to fit this by simply removing the code at REF - 1889
