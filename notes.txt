bug with shift assignment - make sure that < is not follwoed by another < and > not followed by another >

when current cursor at the end and inversion occurs - a cursor selection is created

"key": "ctrl+shift+i",
"mac": "cmd+shift+i",





Knowledge:

REF - 2000
the project does not have bracket depth inference as it is designed the analysis during the first traversal.
E.g:
if ((!(hello)))

will result with:

if (!(hello))

The core reason for this is in the following example, the algorithm doesn't know not to invert !(hello) upfront,
hence it is always safer to invert the first bracket:
if ((!(hello) && cat) || cat) = if (!(!(hello) && cat) && !cat)
