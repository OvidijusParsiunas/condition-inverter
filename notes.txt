tasks:
* Purchase domain
* Get the ci-cd to deploy correctly
* Publish extension
* Get a logo for the app
* Update all of the readmes

extension:

if test coverage is not meeting the threshold exclusively in Windows, need to make sure that the imported ifInverter code is using relative path instead of the module path

website:

the website has an alternative top right logo that is a github corner, however decided to not use it as we need to use a vscode logo as well

currently not detecting the language used, but can implement this via:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/lang-detector

Suggestions:

If removing the brackets along with the exclamation marks is too much:
E.g:
if (!(hello)) = if (hello)

The code can easily be changed to fit this by simply removing the code at REF - 1889
